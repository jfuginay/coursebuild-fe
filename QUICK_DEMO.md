# ðŸŽ¥ Quick Demo Script for Team

## Show Them This:

### 1. Task Management (30 seconds)
```bash
# Show prioritized tasks
npm run task:list

# Add a new task live
npm run task:add "Implement Mercari API integration"

# Show how it auto-categorizes
npm run task:list
```

### 2. RAG Task Detection (1 minute)
```bash
# Create a file with issues
echo "// TODO: Add error handling here" > test.js
echo "const API_KEY = 'hardcoded-key';" >> test.js

# Run the scanner
npm run monitor:scan

# Show it found security issue & TODO
cat detected-tasks.json
```

### 3. Project Structure (30 seconds)
```bash
# Show the clean setup
ls -la

# Show the integrations ready
cat .env.example | grep -E "(EBAY|ETSY)"

# Show the CI/CD ready
cat .github/workflows/sync-tasks.yml
```

## Key Points to Emphasize:

1. **We're Ready to Code**
   - Task system tracks everything
   - APIs researched & documented
   - CI/CD templates ready

2. **Open Source Ready**
   - Auto-detects contributor tasks
   - Clean architecture
   - Great developer experience

3. **24hr MVP Possible**
   - Focus on eBay + Etsy first
   - Use Firebase for quick backend
   - Ship to TestFlight by tomorrow

4. **Unique Value Props**
   - First AI-powered cross-listing tool
   - Open source = community features
   - "Plaid for marketplaces" vision

## Your Talking Points:

"We've built the foundation for the backend infrastructure. We have:

1. A smart task management system that auto-prioritizes and detects issues from code
2. Complete API research - eBay and Etsy have full support, we'll tackle those first
3. A structure ready for open source with automated task detection for contributors

The critical path is clear: Set up Firebase, integrate eBay/Etsy APIs, add AI for descriptions, and ship to TestFlight. With all 4 of us using Claude Code Opus, we can parallelize and have an MVP live in 24 hours.

This isn't just another marketplace app - it's the open source infrastructure for anyone to build marketplace tools. Think Plaid, but for selling stuff online."
