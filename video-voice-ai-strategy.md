```

### Core Components

#### 1. Video Capture & Processing
```javascript
// React Native video recording
import Video from 'react-native-video';
import { Camera } from 'expo-camera';

const VideoRecordingScreen = () => {
  const [recording, setRecording] = useState(false);
  const [videoUri, setVideoUri] = useState(null);
  
  const startRecording = async () => {
    const video = await camera.recordAsync({
      quality: Camera.Constants.VideoQuality['720p'],
      maxDuration: 60, // 1 minute max
      mute: false
    });
    setVideoUri(video.uri);
    processVideo(video.uri);
  };
};
```

#### 2. Speech-to-Text Processing
```javascript
// Using OpenAI Whisper for best accuracy
const extractVoiceData = async (videoUri) => {
  const audioUri = await extractAudio(videoUri);
  
  const response = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}`,
      'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data',
    },
    body: createFormData(audioUri, 'whisper-1')
  });
  
  const { text, segments } = await response.json();
  
  return {
    fullTranscript: text,
    timeSegments: segments, // Time-synced text
    detectedLanguage: response.language,
    confidence: response.confidence
  };
};
```

#### 3. Multimodal AI Analysis
```javascript
// Combine video frames + voice transcript
const analyzeVideoWithVoice = async (videoUri, voiceData) => {
  const frames = await extractKeyFrames(videoUri, 5); // 5 key frames
  
  const prompt = `
    Analyze this item for sale based on:
    
    VISUAL: ${frames.map(f => f.description).join(', ')}
    VOICE: "${voiceData.fullTranscript}"
    
    Extract:
    1. Item details (brand, model, condition, size, color)
    2. Emotional context (excitement, attachment, reasons for selling)
    3. Unique selling points mentioned
    4. Condition assessment from voice tone
    5. Story/provenance if mentioned
    6. Price indicators or value signals
    
    Generate optimized descriptions for: eBay, Etsy, Poshmark, Instagram
  `;
  
  const analysis = await callGPT4Vision(prompt, frames, voiceData);
  return analysis;
};
```

#### 4. Instagram Auto-Posting
```javascript
// Instagram Basic Display API + Business API
const postToInstagram = async (videoUri, caption, hashtags) => {
  // Upload video to Instagram
  const mediaResponse = await fetch(`https://graph.instagram.com/v17.0/${INSTAGRAM_BUSINESS_ID}/media`, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: new FormData({
      media_type: 'VIDEO',
      video_url: videoUri,
      caption: `${caption}\n\n${hashtags.join(' ')}`,
      access_token: INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN
    })
  });
  
  const { id: creationId } = await mediaResponse.json();
  
  // Publish the video
  const publishResponse = await fetch(`https://graph.instagram.com/v17.0/${INSTAGRAM_BUSINESS_ID}/media_publish`, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: new FormData({
      creation_id: creationId,
      access_token: INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN
    })
  });
  
  return publishResponse.json();
};
```

## 🎬 User Experience Flow

### Recording Flow
1. **Tap "Video Listing"** - Camera opens
2. **Hit record** - Start showing and describing item
3. **Natural narration**: "This is my vintage Leica camera, barely used, got it from my grandfather..."
4. **Stop recording** - Processing begins
5. **AI generates**: Optimized listings for all platforms
6. **Review & edit** - User can refine before posting
7. **One-tap posting** - Cross-platform + Instagram

### AI Extraction Examples

#### Example 1: Vintage Camera
**Voice**: "This is my grandfather's 1960s Leica M3, chrome body, works perfectly but I never use it..."

**AI Extracts**:
- Brand: Leica, Model: M3
- Era: 1960s, Condition: Working/Excellent
- Emotional story: Grandfather's camera
- Reason for selling: Not being used
- **Generated eBay title**: "Vintage 1960s Leica M3 Chrome 35mm Camera - Excellent Working Condition"
- **Poshmark description**: "💎 Vintage Leica M3 from the 1960s! This beautiful chrome camera belonged to my grandfather and works perfectly. Such a classic piece but I never use it, so hoping it finds a new home with someone who'll appreciate it! #vintage #leica #camera #photography"

#### Example 2: Designer Handbag
**Voice**: "This is my Chanel bag, got it last year but the color doesn't match my wardrobe, barely carried it maybe 5 times..."

**AI Extracts**:
- Brand: Chanel, Condition: Like New
- Usage: Minimal (5 times)
- Reason: Color mismatch
- **Instagram caption**: "✨ Gorgeous Chanel bag looking for a new home! Got this beauty last year but the color just doesn't work with my style. Barely used (maybe 5x?) so it's practically new! DM if interested 💕 #chanel #designer #handbag #forsale"

## 📊 Advanced AI Features

### Sentiment Analysis
```javascript
const analyzeSentiment = (voiceData) => {
  // Detect seller's emotional attachment
  // High attachment = premium pricing
  // Eager to sell = competitive pricing
  // Nostalgic = add story to description
};
```

### Voice-Based Condition Assessment
```javascript
const assessConditionFromVoice = (transcript) => {
  const conditionIndicators = {
    excellent: ["perfect", "flawless", "mint", "never used"],
    good: ["works great", "some wear", "gently used"],
    fair: ["has issues", "needs work", "cosmetic damage"]
  };
  // Map voice cues to marketplace condition categories
};
```

### Smart Hashtag Generation
```javascript
const generateHashtags = (analysis) => {
  return {
    instagram: ["#vintage", "#forsale", "#[brand]", "#style"],
    tiktok: ["#thrifted", "#declutter", "#smallbusiness"],
    poshmark: ["#[brand]", "#style", "#fashion", "#poshmark"]
  };
};
```

## 🔗 Platform Integration Strategy

### Instagram Business Features
- **Stories integration**: Behind-the-scenes of items
- **Shopping tags**: Direct product links
- **Reels format**: Short, engaging item videos
- **Live shopping**: Real-time selling sessions

### Cross-Platform Optimization
```javascript
const optimizeForPlatform = (analysis, platform) => {
  const optimizations = {
    ebay: {
      title: extractKeywords(analysis, 80), // eBay title limit
      description: formatForeBay(analysis),
      categories: mapToBaybayCategories(analysis.items)
    },
    poshmark: {
      title: addEmojis(analysis.title),
      description: addPersonalTouch(analysis),
      hashtags: generatePoshmarkTags(analysis)
    },
    instagram: {
      caption: createEngagingCaption(analysis),
      hashtags: trendingHashtags(analysis.category),
      musicSuggestion: matchMoodToMusic(analysis.sentiment)
    }
  };
  
  return optimizations[platform];
};
```
